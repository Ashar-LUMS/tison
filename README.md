Networks Editor (NE) allows the user to construct biomolecular networksthat can be analyzed to predict
cell fate outcomes which can then be visualized as three-dimensional landscapes. Several network
analysis strategies, such as Deterministic Modeling have been provided via an intuitive and user-friendly Graphical UserInterface
(GUI). Network analysis results can be viewed as an ‘Attractor Landscape’, ‘Cell Fate Landscape’. NE’s GUI, features list,
network analysis, and result visualization have been outlined.
